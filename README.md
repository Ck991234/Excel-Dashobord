Excel Sales Dashboard Project 
A sales dashboard is a useful tool for tracking the performance of your sales team and understanding the overall health of your business. It provides an overview of sales figures and trends over time, allowing you to identify areas of improvement and take action to boost sales. The dashboard can be configured to show total, daily, weekly, and monthly sales, as well as the status of dispatch. This type of dashboard is particularly useful for tracking sales performance in real-time, helping to ensure that customers get their orders on time and that the team is meeting its objectives. Additionally, it can help to identify potential areas for growth, as well as identify any issues that may be affecting sales.
